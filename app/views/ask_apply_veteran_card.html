       Do you want to apply for a Veteran ID card?
      </h1>
      
      <p>You have completed step one, which confirms that you have served in HM armed forces.</p>
      
      <p>Step 2 involves verifying your identity. This is an extra level of security to help protect you against online identity theft.</p>
      
      <p>You can do this by applying for a Veteran ID card. This is a form of ID that will give you access to services and other benefits you are entitled to as a veteran. You won't need to complete a verification process again.</p>
      
      <p>If you would rather not have a card, but want to prove your veteran status, you still need to prove your identity.</p>
