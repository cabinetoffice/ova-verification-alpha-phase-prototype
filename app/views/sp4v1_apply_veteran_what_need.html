    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">What you'll need</h1>
    
    <p>We need to ask you some details about yourself and the information you are requesting. This is to ensure that only veterans or people who have permission to access their records use this service.</p>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Verifying your identity</h3>
    
    <p>
     As part of this service you will need to verify your identity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     You can do this by:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>using the online Gov.uk Digital Identity service</li>
      <li>applying by post <a href="https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity" target="_new">(opens in a new tab)</a></li>
      <li>going to the Post Office and using the in-branch verification service</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
     Gov.uk Digital Identity is a service which allows you to create a secure online account to store your data.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     Once you have one set up you won't need to input your personal information again in order to access online government services.
    </p>
    
    <p>
     You can track and save your progress and come back to complete the process in multiple sessions if you need to. You will be asked to provide some of the following:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your passport</li>
      <li>your driving licence</li>
      <li>addresses you have lived at for the last 5 years and the dates you lived at them</li>
      <li>your service number/li>
      <li>a passport style photo</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Supporting someone else to apply for a veteran card</h3>
    
    <p>
    To support someone else to apply for a veteran card, you need to provide proof that:

      <li>you have their permission to apply on their behalf</li>
      <li>you have the authority to verify their status</li>

       <li>evidence that you work for one of the approved services that are authorised to verify a veteran's status</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
     If you cannot provide any of these you'll need to apply by post instead  <a href="https://www.postoffice.co.uk/identity" target="_new">(opens in a new tab)</a>
    </p>
    
    {# <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Verifying your own veteran status</h3>
    
    <p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      <li>your enlistment and discharge dates</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Verifying someone else's veteran status</h3>
    
    <p>

    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

       <li>evidence that you work for one of the approved services that are authorised to verify a veteran's status</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
